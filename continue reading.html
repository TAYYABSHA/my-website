ABSTRACT 
E-Teacher Android App is communication between students and teacher. This innovative system allows Teacher to share important data, lecture as well as announcements with students. It consists of a teacher login along with student login. Teachers may upload documents of subject syllabus, documents, notifications, notes etc through their provided login. We propose to develop this Android App that allows teacher to upload data and students may view and download required documents and student may ask question to the teachers and teachers gives the answer of question related to their subject through this App. Here students only see and download data of their particular semester. Teachers gives assignments with deadline, announces quizzes and others activities. Students upload their assignment within due date. When teachers upload syllabus and notes students get notification even student have no internet thorough Sms. Teacher may access and upload/edit documents to any semester and communicate with students with video call.
